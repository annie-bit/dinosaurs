  <div style="background-color:blue;">Dinasaurs first appeared between 247 and 240 million years ago. They ruled the Earth for about 175 million years until an extinction event 65.5 million years ago wiped out all of them, expect for the avian dinosaurs.Dinosaurs did not give birth to live young in the way that mammals do. Like most reptiles, and like birds, female dinosaurs laid a number of eggs. These eggs were usually deposited in a nest made of the twigs and leaves, or in a hole that the female had dug in the soil or sand.
